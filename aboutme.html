<p> You are going to learn a little bit about the Carli Stewart, exciting I know. Even though technology isn't my cup of tea
the fascinating Spanish Language is my jam. I have been taking Spanish since Freshman year, and I aspire to become a Spanish Teacher
because I love Spanish and helping others. I love to go on adventures with my friends and family, creating memories to last a 
lifetime. My music taste is whack, I listen to pretty much EVERYTHING. I am a HUGE Cavs Fan and a pasta salad enthusiast</p>
