<h1>
  CHROMEBOOK STICKER
</h1>

<body>
  <p> We were able to create and conjure up different ideas for stickers that we could put on our chromebooks or whatever we desired.
    I chose to do a hand making the peace sign, which while only printing out 1 sticker I was able to make 2. How did I do that? I took the 
    original print out of the sticker, and then the scraps of it I was still able to use--- and give to my friend to put on her chromebook
