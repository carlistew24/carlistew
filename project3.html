<p> In this project we worked with LED lights and circuit boards. It was more of a trial and error project, which I did like the whole concept
of needing to find other solutions, and understanding why it didn't work. I loved that it was a hands on project and everyone in the class seemed
  to pick up on it real quick and had fun with it. </p>
